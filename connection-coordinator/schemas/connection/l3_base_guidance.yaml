properties:
  asnRanges:
    description: |-
      A list of non-overlapping ASN ranges a provider can select from.

      Many providers only support one ASN. In this case, asn.start == asn.stop.
    items:
      $ref: "asn_range.yaml"
    type: array
  ipv4SubnetGuidance:
    description: |-
      A list of non-overlapping IP subnets a provider can select from.

      Many providers allow connections within the link local IP space.
      Example:

      [
        {
        "includeSubnet": "169.254.0.0/16",
        "excludeSubnet": ["169.254.1.0/28"],
        "preferredSubnet":"169.254.1.16/30"
        }
      ]
    items:
      $ref: "subnet_guidance.yaml"
    type: array
  ipv6SubnetGuidance:
    description: A list of non-overlapping IPv6 subnets a provider can select
      from.
    items:
      $ref: "subnet_guidance.yaml"
    type: array
  ipv4AllowedSubnetPrefixLengths:
    description: |-
      The subnet sizes allowed when selecting an IP subnet for a connection.
      This tells the caller what the valid subnet prefix lengths are within the
      subnet guidance provided. Example: If Subnet Guidance is:
      [
        {
          "includeSubnet": "169.254.0.0/16",
          "excludeSubnet": [],
          "preferredSubnet":"169.254.1.16/29"
        }
      ]
      And ipv4_allowed_subnet_prefix_lengths is [29]
      Then the caller can select a /29 subnet within 169.254.0.0/16.
    items:
      format: int32
      type: integer
    type: array
  ipv6AllowedSubnetPrefixLengths:
    description: |-
      The subnet sizes allowed when selecting an IP subnet for a connection.
      This tells the caller what the valid subnet prefix lengths are within the
      subnet guidance provided. Example: If Subnet Guidance is:
      [
        {
          "includeSubnet": "fd20::/16",
          "excludeSubnet": [],
          "preferredSubnet":"fd20:0:0:1::/64"
        }
      ]
      And ipv6_allowed_subnet_prefix_lengths is [64]
      Then the caller can select a /64 subnet within fd20::/16.

    description: A list of VLANs the provider may select from.

      $ref: "vlan_range.yaml"
    type: array
  mtuRanges:
    description: |-
      A list of non-overlapping MTU ranges a provider can select from.

      Special note: This represents the MTU limits at the connection points
      between providers, there may be further limitations within provider
      networks that must be explained in customer facing APIs and / or
      documentation.
    items:
      $ref: "mtu_range.yaml"
    type: array
  maxReceivedBgpRoutePrefixes:
    description: |-
      Maximum number of BGP route prefixes accepted by the connection.

      While not negotiated between providers, providers must be aware that if
      more BGP route prefixes are announced, protocol behavior will be
      undefined.
