  Connection resources contain all connection wide details about a connection
  configured on behalf of a customer between two clouds.

  Connection resources must have the following attributes:

  1. When created, the connection must reserve bandwidth on their associated
      interconnect.
  2. A remote provider must create a connection locally before requesting a
      server provider create a connection.
  3. Connections that were never finalized may be deleted by either provider
      after 7 days.
  4. Connections present on only one provider may be deleted after 7 days.
  5. When deleted, the server provider is responsible for invalidating the key
      material associated with the connection to avoid accidental reuse.
