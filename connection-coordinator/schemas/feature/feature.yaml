      Required. The URI of the channel this feature is associated with.

      Each feature is only associated with a single channel and the channel must
      exist. Each connection resource will have a child feature for each channel
      that is a child of the parent interconnect resource. For example a
      connection that is a child of an interconnect with 4 channels will have 4
      child features, each associated with a different channel.
