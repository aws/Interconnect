Interconnect:
  description: |-
    Interconnect resources describe a group of redundant physical links between
    providers that are used to provision redundant connections for a customer.

    Interconnect resource 'name' and 'supported_connection_size_mbps' are
    exchanged between providers at setup time.  This allows both providers to
    call each other's respective APIs with a shared resource key and lookup
    additional dynamic details about the connectivity.

    All other fields are controlled by the server provider.
  example:
    supportedFeatures:
    - FEATURE_TYPE_L3_BASE
    - FEATURE_TYPE_L3_BASE
    name: name
    state: ""
    supportedConnectionSizeMbps:
    - 0
    - 0
    maxBandwidthMbps: 6
  properties:
    name:
      description: Identifier. Unique identifier for the Interconnect resource.
      type: string
    supportedConnectionSizeMbps:
      description: |-
        Output only. A list of Mbps connection sizes supported on the interconnect.  This field
        must contain all supported connection sizes defined in the parent
        environment but may include additional sizes specific to this interconnect.

    supportedFeatures:
      description: |-
        Output only. A list of features supported by the interconnect.  Any child connections of
        this interconnect may have the specified features configured on them. This
        field must contain all supported features defined in the parent
        environment but may include additional features specific to this
        interconnect.

    state:

      - $ref: "#/InterconnectState"
      description: |-
        Output only. The operational state of the interconnect used to control connection
        provisioning.
      readOnly: true
    maxBandwidthMbps:
      description: |-
        Output only. Specified the aggregate connection bandwidth that can be configured on the
        interconnect.  Generally this value matches the minimum channel bandwidth
        across all channels associated with the interconnect.  However, this field
        allows a a provider to limit the total connection bandwidth below the
        aggregate physical capacity.

        If not respected by the remote provider, connection creation that exceeds
        this threshold will fail.

InterconnectState:
  description: |-
    Enum that describes the state of an Interconnect.
    INTERCONNECT_STATE_PENDING - Provisioning is pending and not ready for production traffic.
    INTERCONNECT_STATE_ACTIVE - Provisioning is complete and ready for production traffic.
    INTERCONNECT_STATE_CLOSED - Functional for current customers but closed to new connections.
  enum:
  - INTERCONNECT_STATE_PENDING
  - INTERCONNECT_STATE_ACTIVE
  - INTERCONNECT_STATE_CLOSED
  type: string
