description: 'An issue as expressed by a remote provider related to shared resources
  with

  the local provider.


  Outside of the standard issue fields (body, title, etc), context objects are

  included to allow callers to provide explicit resources associated with the

  issue.  These resources may have additional metadata associated with them
  to

  further describe the issue.


  To further standardize the information within a request, the IssueContext

  describes a preset issue type that a provider must be capable of handling.

  This issue type may require specific context be provided in the request.  If

  so, the provider may reject the request if that context is not provided.'
