  Channels describe individual physical connections that connect a remote
  provider's router to a server provider's router.

  The following fields are pre-exchanged between providers when
  provisioning capacity:

  1. name

  2. macsec_manager_provider_id

  3. cross_connect_manager_provider_id

  All other fields within the channel are populated by the server provider.
example:
  demarc: demarc
  crossConnectManagerProvider: crossConnectManagerProvider
  channelMemberSizeGbps: 6
  name: name
  adminState: ""
  macsecManagerProvider: macsecManagerProvider
  aggregateChannelSizeGbps: 0
  obfuscatedDeviceId: obfuscatedDeviceId
properties:
  name:
    description: Identifier. Unique identifier for the Channel resource.
    type: string
  macsecManagerProvider:
    description: |-
      Output only. The URI of the provider responsible for managing MacSec key rotations.

      This field must prevent the non-manager provider from calling Macsec
      APIs.
    readOnly: true
    type: string
  crossConnectManagerProvider:
    description: |-

      includes cross connect costs and any troubleshooting requests to the vendor
      providing the cross connect.
    readOnly: true
    type: string
  aggregateChannelSizeGbps:
    description: Output only. Aggregate channel size in gigabits per second.
    format: int32
    readOnly: true
    type: integer
  channelMemberSizeGbps:
    description: Output only. Individual channel member size in gigabits per
      second.
    format: int32
    readOnly: true
    type: integer
  obfuscatedDeviceId:
    description: |-
      Output only. An obfuscated device ID associated with the network device hosting the
      channel.  This field allows providers to check that channel diversity
      requirements are met within a parent interconnect resource.
    readOnly: true
    type: string
  demarc:
    description: |-
      A demarcation identifier that uniquely identifies where the cross connect
