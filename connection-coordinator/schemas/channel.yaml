Channel:
  description: |-
    Channels describe individual physical connections that connect a remote
    provider's router to a server provider's router.

    The following fields are pre-exchanged between providers when
    provisioning capacity:

    1. name

    2. macsec_manager_provider_id

    3. cross_connect_manager_provider_id

    All other fields within the channel are populated by the server provider.
  example:
    demarc: demarc
    crossConnectManagerProvider: crossConnectManagerProvider
    channelMemberSizeGbps: 6
    name: providers/my-provider/environments/my-environment/interconnects/my-interconnect/channels/my-channel
    adminState: ""
    macsecManagerProvider: macsecManagerProvider
    aggregateChannelSizeGbps: 0
    obfuscatedDeviceId: obfuscatedDeviceId
  properties:
    name:

        This field must prevent the non-manager provider from calling Macsec
        APIs.

    crossConnectManagerProvider:
      description: |-
        Output only. The URI of the provider responsible for managing physical crossconnects.  This

      type: string
    demarc:
      description: |-
        A demarcation identifier that uniquely identifies where the cross connect
        is connected.  This identifier is typically provided by the colocation
        facility and can be found in letters of authorization when turning up
        capacity.

    adminState:
      allOf:
      - $ref: common.yaml#/AdminState
      description: |-
        Output only. The administrative status of the channel.  This field is used by a provider
