Feature:
  description: |-
    Feature resources describe all configuration per-channel that is required to
    enable a feature for a specified connection.
  example:
    name: name
    channel: channel
    featureConfig: ""
    provisioningState: ""
  properties:
    name:
      description: Identifier. A unique identifier for the feature resource.
      type: string
    channel:
      description: |-
        Required. The URI of the channel this feature is associated with.

        Each feature is only associated with a single channel and the channel must
        exist. Each connection resource will have a child feature for each channel
        that is a child of the parent interconnect resource. For example a
        connection that is a child of an interconnect with 4 channels will have 4
        child features, each associated with a different channel.
