Provider:
  description: |-
    Provider resources encapsulate all information that describe the
    relationship between a remote provider and a server provider.

    When a remote provider calls this API, the provider should always reference
    their assigned provider id.  Provider IDs are globally unique, and stored in
    this specification's opensource repository.  This allows a remote provider to
    have access to multiple provider IDs as business relationship change over
    time.

    For example, if we have two providers (ProviderA, ProviderB) who are
    coordinating connections with this API, when ProviderA (remote provider)
    calls this API hosted by ProviderB (server provider), their requests will
    always be prefixed by:

    Prefix: providers/

    If the server provider has decided that ProviderA's credentials allow them to
    access additional credentials (through something like an acquisition),
    ProviderA may access all resources under ProviderC.

    ProviderB must also allow ProviderA to access the server's provider resource
    (providers/).  This provides ProviderA with access to relevant
    information about the server provider (such as display names).
  example:
    displayName: displayName
    name: providers/my-provider
  properties:
    name:
      description: |-
        Identifier. Unique identifier for a Provider resource.

        Every provider that supports the cloud connectivity API will receive a
        centrally managed provider ID, stored alongside this specification in the
        opensource project, that uniquely identifies them.  When accessing a remote
        cloud connectivity server, the provider will use their provider ID to
        request and create resources within the remote server.
