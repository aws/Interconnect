    Notify a remote provider that the provisioning status of a connection has
    changed.

    A provider will typically send a remote provider two updates:
    1) A notification when a newly created channel has transitioned from
        PENDING to FINALIZED
    2) A notification when an existing channel transitions from FINALIZED
        to PENDING.  This happens when features change and need finalization.
    3) A notification when a channel is FINALIZED after a feature change.
