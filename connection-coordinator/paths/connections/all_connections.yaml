    Create a new connection associated with a given interconnect.

    When calling this API, remote providers must first create a connection
    resource locally.  This ensures the remote provider can handle server
    failures (retries and cleanup).

    If connection creation fails, the provider should restart their call flow
    refreshing any environment and interconnect details used to create the
    request and retry.  When retrying, client should use an exponential
    backoff strategy for up to 60 seconds.

    Errors:
        409: CONFLICT. The resource is being created or has already been
        created.
